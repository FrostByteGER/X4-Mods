# No-RCS-SFX
So after playing the game quite a while I grew tired of constantly hearing the RCS thruster sound effects that play when you use the WSAD
keys to drift.
So I present to you this simple mod!

It reduces the volume to 75, 50, 25 or 0% for the RCS thruster sounds for all ship types, even the EVA suit.

Works with Version 1.00-4.x and its DLC

## Installation:
Unzip the folder into your extensions directory inside the X4
Foundations folder. If there is no extensions directory, simply create
one.

## Uninstallation:
Simple delete the no_rcs_sfx folder. The mod does not affect your savegame in any way.
